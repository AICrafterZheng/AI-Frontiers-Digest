SS_TO_DESCRIPTION = """
You are tasked with generating a detailed description of a screenshot of a webpage. This description will be used to create QA test cases, so it's important to focus on elements that are relevant for testing purposes.

First, you will be provided with a screenshot of a webpage.

Your task is to analyze this description and generate a comprehensive, structured description of the webpage. Focus on the following key elements:

1. Layout and structure of the page
2. Navigation elements (menus, buttons, links)
3. Content areas (text blocks, images, videos)
4. User input fields (forms, search bars)
5. Interactive elements (dropdowns, toggles, sliders)
6. Visual design elements (color scheme, typography, icons)

When generating your description:

1. Start with an overview of the page's purpose and main sections.
2. Describe each major element in detail, including its location on the page and its functionality.
3. Note any potential user interactions with each element.
4. Identify any dynamic content or elements that may change based on user actions.
5. Mention any error states or edge cases that might be visible.
6. Pay attention to accessibility features or potential issues.

Provide your description in a structured format, using appropriate headings and subheadings. Use bullet points or numbered lists where applicable to improve readability.

Remember to focus on aspects that would be relevant for QA testing, such as:
- Functionality of interactive elements
- Consistency of design and layout
- Proper display of content
- Potential user flows through the page
- Edge cases or potential error states

Begin your response with <webpage_description> and end it with </webpage_description>. Within these tags, use appropriate HTML-style tags to structure your description (e.g., <header>, <main_content>, <footer>, <navigation>, etc.).

ECOMMERCE_PROMPT = """
Identify Core Features: Break down the e-commerce site into major functional areas:

User account creation and authentication
Product catalog (browsing, searching, filtering)
Shopping cart and checkout flow
Payment and refunds
Order history and tracking
Seller functionalities (if applicable)
Customer support features (returns, disputes)
Define Success Criteria: For each core feature, specify what success looks like (e.g., successful registration, order placement, etc.). These success criteria will help guide both positive and negative test scenarios.

Create a Traceability Matrix: Map each test case to the corresponding requirement or user story. This ensures full coverage and makes it easier to see if any requirement is missing or if any test case is not aligned to a requirement.

2. Organize Test Cases by Functional Areas
A structured way to manage complexity is to group test cases by functional area or user flow. Common groupings include:

User Registration & Login

Positive scenarios (valid details, social login, two-factor authentication)
Negative scenarios (invalid email, incorrect password, locked accounts)
Product Search & Discovery

Searching with valid product keywords, filtering by categories, sorting by price/rating
Searching with invalid input (special characters, empty search)
Checking if the correct product details appear (images, description, pricing)
Product Details Page

Correct display of product name, price, reviews, available stock, seller information
Image zoom, multiple images, or 360° view (if applicable)
Variant/option selection (size, color, etc.)
Shopping Cart & Wishlist

Adding products to cart/wishlist from product listings or product details page
Updating quantity or removing items
Verifying item prices, subtotals, taxes, shipping costs
Checkout Flow

Address selection/entry
Shipping method selection (standard, expedited, international)
Payment gateway options (credit card, PayPal, gift cards, etc.)
Order confirmation (verify total, discounts, shipping cost, tax)
Negative scenarios like invalid payment details, expired cards, incorrect CVV, etc.
Order Management

Viewing and filtering order history
Order status updates (pending, shipped, delivered, canceled, returned)
Return and refund process (initiate return, refund confirmation)
Seller and Marketplace Features (if applicable)

Listing products
Editing product details (title, description, price)
Managing inventory and orders
Seller performance metrics (ratings, feedback)
Customer Support & Feedback

Contacting support
Initiating disputes or claims
Submitting product reviews and feedback
3. Include Both Positive and Negative Scenarios
Positive Test Cases: Ensure the system works as intended with valid inputs, correct user flows, and typical user actions.

Example: A user with valid credentials can log in and place an order successfully.
Negative Test Cases: Anticipate user mistakes or malicious actions and ensure the site handles them gracefully.

Example: Entering a shipping address with special characters or leaving required fields blank.
Example: Trying to proceed to checkout with an empty cart.
Boundary & Edge Cases: Test limits such as maximum character lengths, extreme price values, or very large product quantities in the cart.

4. Consider Different User Roles & Access Controls
Guest Users: Browsing, adding to cart, checkout with or without registration.
Registered Customers: Access to wishlists, saved addresses, order history, etc.
Sellers (if it’s a marketplace): Listing products, managing orders and refunds.
Administrators: Handling product approval, user management, reporting, etc.
